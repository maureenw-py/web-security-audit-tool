# Basic Web Security Audit Tool

A lightweight Python tool that performs common web security checks and generates Markdown and JSON reports.

This tool is designed to assess websites and web applications for common security misconfigurations that increase the attack surface and may enable exploitation. It is intended for learning, portfolio demonstration, and lightweight assessments. It is **not** a replacement for full penetration testing.

---

## Scope of Security Checks

This tool assesses the following areas:

- Transport security and SSL/TLS configuration
- HTTP security headers and cookie attributes
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies
- Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
- Client-side JavaScript usage and third-party integrations
- Form handling and basic input security indicators
- Publicly accessible files, directories, and endpoints
- Metadata disclosure and in-page comments
- Redirect behavior and URL handling

---

## Features

- Performs multiple web security checks in a single scan
- Safe HTTP handling with retries and configurable timeouts
- Generates Markdown and JSON reports
- Logs check results and partial failures
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/maureenw-py/web-security-audit-tool
cd web-security-audit-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Usage\*\*

CLI options allow the user to select which checks to perform and whether to generate reports. Below is a full scan of the target url that returns a JSON and a Markdown report.
python scanner.py https://example.com --full_scan --document

---

## Example Output

See the example_output/ directory for sample Markdown and JSON reports generated by the tool.

## Design Decisions

- The project is intentionally kept simple to avoid unnecessary over-engineering.
- Checks emit findings via a callback instead of shared globals.
- The scanner owns orchestration and lifecycle; checks remain stateless.
- Partial failures are recorded without stopping the scan.
- Logging is consistent across all components to improve traceability and debugging.

---

## Limitations

- Not a replacement for professional security testing
- No authentication handling
- No HTML or PDF report generation

---

## Future Improvements

- HTML/PDF report rendering
- Additional security checks
- Configurable severity scoring
