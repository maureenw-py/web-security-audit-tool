This assessment highlights areas where the application’s security posture can be strengthened through improved configuration, hardening, and adherence to recommended security practices. Addressing identified weaknesses will help reduce exposure to common web-based threats and improve the overall resilience of the application.

Remediation efforts should prioritise high-risk findings, followed by medium-risk and informational observations as part of ongoing security maintenance. Once corrective actions have been implemented, a follow-up review is recommended to validate remediation and ensure that security controls are operating as intended.
