This assessment was limited to the target application and URLs explicitly provided by the client. Only publicly accessible interfaces and resources were evaluated unless otherwise agreed in writing.

**The following were in scope:**

- The provided target URL and its publicly reachable endpoints.

- HTTP and HTTPS responses returned by the application.

- Client-side content delivered to the browser.

**The following were out of scope:**

- Denial-of-service testing.

- Social engineering or phishing attacks.

- Password brute-force attacks.

- Authenticated functionality (unless explicitly authorized).

- Infrastructure, network, or host-level security testing.

- Third-party services not directly controlled by the client.

Testing was conducted in a non-intrusive manner and did not intentionally attempt to disrupt application availability.
